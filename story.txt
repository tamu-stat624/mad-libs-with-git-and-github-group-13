Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Praveen,

I am writing to you from a good spaceship in a bad galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a blue rocket in june. There are 27 apples and mobiles of India here! In the
bathroom there is a pool full of thumbs up. I fall asleep each night on a great bed of
cotton and dream of jogging fastly. It feels as though I have lived here for
42 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
swimming on a bright car!!

Best wishes,
Kiran
