Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [1],

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] [7] and bikes of India here! In the
bathroom there is a pool full of thumbsup. I fall asleep each night on a cruel bed of
water and dream of sleeping blindly. It feels as though I have lived here for
10 [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
