Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Sam,

I am writing to you from a beautiful spaceship in a tall galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a white rocket in January. There are 10 dogs and bikes of India here! In the
bedroom there is a pool full of thumbsup. I fall asleep each night on a friendly bed of
rubber and dream of running blindly. It feels as though I have lived here for
100 seconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
driving on a fast car!!

Best wishes,
Rajesh
